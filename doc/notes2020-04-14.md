1. To create data base:

    $ mysql -u root -p
    [password or just enter if one isn't set]
    MariaDB [(none)]> # cut and paste code/setup.sql script
    MariaDB [(none)]> quit;

To start over

    $ mysql -u studio -pstudio # no space between -p and password
    MariaDB [r] use r;
    MariaDB [r] drop table jgr;
    MariaDB [r] # cut and paste lines 2:35 from code/setup.sql script

Deprecated to end of this file
2. Preparation of *.txt files can be done in shell

# remove false headers
# take file name as the identifier
# cross map varnames; should just leave holes?


# insert identifier as first column

  awk -F, '{$1= FILENAME FS $1;}1' OFS=, part1.tsv

# now need to substitute first subsitution with "id"

# assumes always three false header lines; otherwise need to delete down to first line beginning with V1, which is doable with sed


todo: extract the filename without the extension
  
Here's how it would be done given the processed file

    $ mysql -u studio -p
    [password]
    MariaDB [r]>
    
    LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'home/roc/projects/jgr/obj/part1.tsv'
    INTO TABLE jgr;
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
    
For only 70 input files, I'd be inclined to simply spit out the three lines from the list of tsv file names using a script and cut and paste into the MariaDB setting, since it's a one-time operation

mysqlimport loads tables from text files in various formats. The base name of the text file must be the name of the table that should be used. 

mysqlimport fields-terminated-by ',' lines terminated by '\n' r jgr


#!/bin/bash
#loop to iterate through each file in current directory and rename
ext = ".txt"
for file in ???
do
  basename $file .txt
  
  awk -F, '{$1 = FILENAME FS $1;}1' OFS = , jgr   | 
    sed 1,3d  | 
    sed 1,1s/"part1.tsv"/"id"/ | 
    sed s/".tsv"// | 
    sed 's/\t/,/g' | 
    sed 1,1s/"V"/"v"/g 
    
| 
    mysqlimport fields-terminated-by ',' lines terminated by '\n' r jgr #
    mv jgr basename$ext # ?
done


  mv basename $1 .txt jgr


  mv basename $file .txt jgr
